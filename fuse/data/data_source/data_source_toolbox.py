        Partition the data into folds while using no_mixture_id for which no mixture between folds should be forced.
        and using key_columns as the keys for which balancing is forced.
        The functions creates ID level labeling which is the cross-section of all possible mixture of key columns for that id
        it creates the folds so each fold will have about same proportions of ID level labeling while each ID will appear only in one fold
        For exmaple - patient with ID 1234 has 2 images , each image has a binary classification (benign / malignant) .
        it can be that both of his images are benign or both are malignant or one is benign and the other is malignant.
