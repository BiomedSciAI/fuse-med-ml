    "# Visualization Package\n",
    "Extremely flexible tool to visualize and debug the data pipeline (data loading, processing, and augmentation ) suitable for machine learning experiments.  The package comes with a rich collection of visualizers and workflows. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "**sample_dict** - Represents a single sample and contains all relevant information about the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "No specific structure of this dictionary is required, but a useful pattern is to split it into sections (keys that define a \"namespace\" ): such as \"data\", \"model\",  etc.\n",
    "NDict (fuse/utils/ndict.py) class is used instead of python standard dictionary in order to allow easy \".\" seperated access. For example:\n",
    "`sample_dict[“data.input.img”]` is the equivallent of `sample_dict[\"data\"][\"input\"][\"img\"]`\n",
    "\n",
    "conventions :\n",
    "1. you should include suffix specifying the type of the value (\"img\", \"seg\", \"bbox\") - which will be used by the type detector ( see VisProbe Op)\n",
    "2. you can optionaly give a name to your pipeline by sample_dict[\"name\"] = \"kits21\" and it will show up in every image and file created by the visualizer\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Op(erator)\n",
    "\n",
    "Operators are the building blocks of the sample processing pipeline. Each operator gets as input the *sample_dict* as created by the previous operators and can either add/delete/modify fields in sample_dict. The operator interface is specified in OpBase class. \n",
    "A pipeline is built as a sequence of operators, which do everything - loading a new sample, preprocessing, augmentation, and more.\n",
    "The visualization tool is integrated in the pipeline using the VisProbe operation\n",
    "\n",
    "## VisProbe Op\n",
    "This op can be placed between different steps at the pipeline , each step can have an optional name which will appear in every image and file created by the visualizer\n",
    "This op requires the following inputs in each call :\n",
    "1. give the input keys that define a \"namespace\" which included your input\n",
    "2. type detector object of class TypeDetectorPatternsBased - used to detect the input type from previous step and convert it to the right class \n",
    "3. visualizer - instance of a class that inherits from VisualizerBase ( SaveVisual - to save to nifti files , Imaging2dVisualizer - to save multiple 2d images in one file)\n",
    "4. output_path - path to save the images\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "A sequence of operators loading, pre-processing, and augmenting a sample. We split the pipeline into two parts - static and dynamic, which allow us to control the part out of the entire pipeline that will be cached. To learn more see *Adding a dynamic part*"
