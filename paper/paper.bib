ABSTRACT = {In current clinical practice, it is difficult to predict whether a patient receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for breast cancer is likely to encounter recurrence after treatment and have the cancer recur locally in the breast or in other areas of the body. We explore the use of clinical history, immunohistochemical markers, and multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (DCE, ADC, Dixon) to predict the risk of post-treatment recurrence within five years. We performed a retrospective study on a cohort of 1738 patients from Institut Curie and analyzed the data using classical machine learning, image processing, and deep learning. Our results demonstrate the ability to predict recurrence prior to NAC treatment initiation using each modality alone, and the possible improvement achieved by combining the modalities. When evaluated on holdout data, the multimodal model achieved an AUC of 0.75 (CI: 0.70, 0.80) and 0.57 specificity at 0.90 sensitivity. We then stratified the data based on known prognostic biomarkers. We found that our models can provide accurate recurrence predictions (AUC &gt; 0.89) for specific groups of women under 50 years old with poor prognoses. A version of our method won second place at the BMMR2 Challenge, with a very small margin from being first, and was a standout from the other challenge entries.},

abstract="Simulating the disease progression of a suspicious finding in mammography (MG) images could assist in the early detection of breast cancer, where the telltale signs of malignancy are subtle and hard to detect. It could also decrease both unnecessary biopsies and treatments of indolent or low-grade disease that might otherwise remain asymptomatic. We propose a novel approach to simulating disease progression, as a significant step towards those goals. Our architecture uses the powerful Wasserstein GAN in combination with a novel component that simulates the progression of the disease in deep feature space. This allows us to learn from unlabeled longitudinal MG pairs of current and prior studies, stabilize the learning procedure, and overcome misalignment between the MG pairs. Our output image replicates an actual MG image, maintains the prior's shape and general appearance while also containing a finding with characteristics that resemble the current image's suspicious finding. We simulate a progression of: (i) a full MG prior image in low-resolution, and (ii) a high-resolution patch in suspicious areas of the prior image. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our pipeline in achieving the above goals using quantitative and qualitative metrics and a reader study. Our results show the high quality of our simulation and the promise it holds for early risk stratification.",

abstract="Characterization of lesions by artificial intelligence (AI) has been the subject of extensive research. In recent years, many studies demonstrated the ability of convolution neural networks (CNNs) to successfully distinguish between malignant and benign breast lesions in mammography (MG) images. However, to date, no study has assessed the specific sub-type of lesions in MG images, as detailed in histolopathology reports. We present a method for finer classification of breast lesions in MG images into multiple pathology sub-types. Our approach works well with radiologists' diagnostic workflow, and uses data available in radiology reports. The proposed Dual-Radiology Dual-Resolution Network (Du-Rad Du-Res Net) receives dual input from the radiologist and dual image resolutions. The radiologist input includes annotation of the lesion area and semantic radiology features; the dual image resolutions comprise a low resolution of the entire mammogram and a high resolution of the lesion area. The network estimates the likelihood of malignancy, as well as the associated pathological sub-type. We show that the combined input of the lesion region of interest (ROI) and the entire mammogram is important for optimizing the model's performance. We tested the AI in a reader study on a dataset of 100 heldout cases. The AI outperformed three breast radiologists in the task of lesion histopathology sub-typing.",

    abstract = { Background Computational models based on artificial intelligence (AI) are increasingly used to diagnose malignant breast lesions. However, assessment from radiologic images of the specific pathologic lesion subtypes, as detailed in the results of biopsy procedures, remains a challenge. Purpose To develop an AI-based model to identify breast lesion subtypes with mammograms and linked electronic health records labeled with histopathologic information. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, 26 569 images were collected in 9234 women who underwent digital mammography to pretrain the algorithms. The training data included individuals who had at least 1 year of clinical and imaging history followed by biopsy-based histopathologic diagnosis from March 2013 to November 2018. A model that combined convolutional neural networks with supervised learning algorithms was independently trained to make breast lesion predictions with data from 2120 women in Israel and 1642 women in the United States. Results were reported using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) with the 95\% DeLong approach to estimate CIs. Significance was tested with bootstrapping. Results The Israeli model was validated in 456 women and tested in 441 women (mean age, 51 years ± 11 [SD]). The U.S. model was validated in 350 women and tested in 344 women (mean age, 60 years ± 12). For predicting malignancy in the test sets (consisting of 220 Israeli patient examinations and 126 U.S. patient examinations with ductal carcinoma in situ or invasive cancer), the algorithms obtained an AUC of 0.88 (95\% CI: 0.85, 0.91) and 0.80 (95\% CI: 0.74, 0.85) for Israeli and U.S. patients, respectively (P = .006). These results may not hold for other cohorts of patients, and generalizability across populations should be further investigated. Conclusion The results offer supporting evidence that artificial intelligence applied to clinical and mammographic images can identify breast lesion subtypes when the data are sufficiently large, which may help assess diagnostic workflow and reduce biopsy sampling errors.
