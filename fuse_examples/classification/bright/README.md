FuseMedML is an open-source python-based framework designed to enhance collaboration and accelerate discoveries in Fused Medical data through advanced Machine Learning technologies. 

Initial version is PyTorch-based and focuses on deep learning on medical imaging.

## Abstract
The aim of the BRIGHT challenge is to provide an opportunity for the development, testing and evaluation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models for automatic breast tumor subtyping of frequent lesions along with rare pathologies, by using clinical Hematoxylin & Eosin (H&E) stained gigapixel Whole-Slide Images (WSIs). 

To this end, a large annotated cohort of WSIs, which includes Noncancerous (Pathological Benign, Usual Ductal Hyperplasia), Precancerous (Flat Epithelia Atypia, Atypical Ductal Hyperplasia) and Cancerous (Ductal Carcinoma in Situ, Invasive Carcinoma) categories, will be available. BRIGHT is the first breast tumor subtyping challenge that includes atypical lesions and consists of more than 550 annotated WSIs across a wide spectrum of tumor subtypes. 

The Challenge includes two tasks: (1) WSI classification into three classes as per cancer risk, and (b) WSI classification into six fine-grained lesion subtypes.

## Data
BReAst Carcinoma Subtyping (BRACS) dataset , a cohort of H&E-stained breast tissue biopsies.. Details can be found in [challenge website]()

## Evaluation
The participants should submit a .csv file per task containing a row with a final class predictions and per-class score for each patient in the test set. The rows must adhere (including header row) to the following scheme:

**Task 1 Prediction File:**
\[image_name,predicted_label,Noncancerous-score,Precancerous-score,Cancerous-score\]

See [example prediction file]("[eval/example_task1_predictions.csv](https://github.com/IBM/fuse-med-ml/blob/master/fuse_examples/classification/bright/eval/example/example_task1_predictions.csv)")

**Task 2 Prediction File:**
\[image_name,predicted_label,PB-score,UDH-score,FEA-score,ADH-score,DCIS-score,IC-score\]

See [example prediction file]("https://github.com/IBM/fuse-med-ml/blob/master/fuse_examples/classification/bright/eval/example/example_task2_predictions.csv")

Where â€œimage_name" represents the sample (e.g. BRACS_264) and all scores represent the probability of a patient to belong to a class.

The evaluation script together with a dummy prediction files can be found in `fuse-med-ml/fuse_examples/classification/bright/eval`
